# Lumocards

---
Lumocards One is a todo app, project manager, and calendar rolled into a CLI. 
It's based around the idea of "cards" similar to projects like Trello.

It's currently available for MacOS / Linux, but support for Windows will come with time. 
## Getting Started

After downloading / cloning this folder, open it or navigate to it in the terminal. Then, type in the following or paste the line below.

`source ./lumo_install.sh; lumo_install`

Doing that step installs all the dependencies for the project into a virtual environment. 
Afterwards, once the environment is activated, you have the option of the use of multiple command line keywords which are usually
prefixed with 'lumo' such as 'lumocards'.

Anytime you want to work on Lumo, you will first need to activate the environment by retyping: `source ./lumo_install.sh`.
(Remember: you will need to be inside Lumo folder when you source the script.)
