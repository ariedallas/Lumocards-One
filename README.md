# Lumocards

### Getting Started

After downloading / cloning this folder, open it or navigate to it in the terminal. Then, type in the following or paste the line below. From this moment on, whenever you use Lumo you must always check you are in this folder first in the terminal otherwise it won't work.

`source ./lumo_install.sh; lumo_install`

Doing that step installs all the dependencies for the project into a virtual environment. 
Afterwards, once the environment is activated, you have the option of the use of multiple command line keywords which are usually
prefixed with 'lumo' such as 'lumocards'.

Anytime you want to work on Lumo, you will first need to activate the environment by retyping: `source ./lumo_install.sh`.
(Remember: you will need to be inside Lumo folder when you source the script.) 

The full list of keywords is available below, in the 'operations' section.
